          Wait What? Pricing? That's funny. I don't own this damn stuff and I
          defiinitely don't want to be caught making money shadily. Nah call me
          loser or something but I think I will stick to the good ol' developing
          although it's a pain in the ass.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why have I got the pricing page then? Honestly, this was in the UI
          design that I copied and I was not in the mood to interfere with that
          so cheers. Let's get moving now shall we?
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, I am not sure why we are still here though. It's not as if
          reading this is somehow making you money (or me somehow womp womp ).
          You could be doing many better things like watching the good ol' Messi
          highlights. And speaking of pleasury things, how can I not mention the nice handy beating of the
          meat and even better if you're from Alabama then you could also be
          joined by yo... Nvm. I ain't even funny or else she wouldn't have
          ignored me like that so I guess I'll see myself out now.
